<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    This is a utility for viewing and analyzing Discord Server Template snapshots.
</p>
<p>
    A <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041033511-Server-Templates">Server Template</a> is a
    feature that someone with <strong>Manager Server</strong> can enable.  It's intended to be a way to easily use one
    server as a template to create other servers.  The template is a snapshot of key information about the server's
    configuration, including category/channel layout, roles and permission overwrites.
</p>
<p>
    Enabling the Server Template feature doesn't affect the operation of the server in any way.  However, after certain
    changes are made you'll notice a prompt about the template being stale.  Discord won't update the template automatically;
    rather you have to go into the UI to force it to regenerate this.  While the template exists you'll have a random
    key value assigned to identify it.  If you delete the template, that key is gone forever, but you can always just
    turn it back on and get a new one.
</p>
<p>
    Though still <a href="https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/pull/1712">undocumented</a>, the new template
    function is accessible via an unauthenticated web request to <code>https://discord.com/api/v6/guilds/templates/{key}</code>.
    Calling this will return a large json document containing information that represents the server.
</p>
<p>
    This tool simply takes the key (or key url) you provide, requests the json and then interprets it in a readable
    report layout.  It also attempts to analyze roles and permission overwrites to identify settings that may be
    unnecessary.  A bot could perform a similar function through the Discord API, but this method provides similar detail
    and does not require that anything join your server.  One limitation of this approach is that member data is not
    part of the template, so no member overwrites are considered.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Privacy: </strong> Server Templates do not contain any fundamentally personal information, but they do
    reveal how you've named roles and channels.  If you enable Server Templates, you are creating a url endpoint in
    Discord's platform that anyone with your template link can use to read this information.  By entering your link
    above, you're enabling this service to fetch your template json, format it and present it back to you.  If you do
    not want your template to be accessible on an ongoing basis, you can always delete or recreate it.
